# tictactoe
This is working tic tac toe game in java that has a 1 or 2 player mode and GUI. It uses the MVC(model/view/controller) design scheme 
so just navigate to the source folder and download those 3 files. As long as you have all 3 you can run the controller file in any IDE
that supports java(I used Eclipse).
